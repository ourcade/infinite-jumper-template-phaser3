## Overview

This is the source code for an infinite jumper starting point in Phaser 3 as created by the free book: Infinite Jumper in Phaser 3 with Modern JavaScript.

This project uses no tooling and is intended for beginners to easily start developing games for the web.

## Getting Started

The Infinite Jumper in Phaser 3 with Modern JavaScript book suggests using the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code to launch a development server.

JavaScript files are included via the `<script type="module">` tag. A modern browser like Chrome is recommended.

## Modern JavaScript

This project uses modern/ES6 JavaScript syntax without transpilers like Babel.

The source JavaScript files can be deployed and served to modern browsers without going through a bundling process.

Bundling and minification may still be recommended for optimal delivery performance.

Deployment is not handled in this project.
